# NCAA Men's Basketball Predictor
This web application takes data collected about teams participating in the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament in the 2009/10 - 2018/19 seasons to predict what round a given team would be knocked out in. The project is still in progress as I look to expand the available data to include other advanced analytics data including data from the KenPom rankings as well as ESPN's Basketball Power Index (BPI) for NCAA teams. The current web application can be found [here]<https://ncaambb-predictor.herokuapp.com/>
